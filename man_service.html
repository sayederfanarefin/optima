IT Solution offers to its clients a very rich selection of IT services for application software development, web solutions &amp; multimedia solutions. We offer services in various technological areas and domain areas. The following areas include:</p>
<p><strong> Project Management</strong>:<br />
Project management, is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.</p>
<p>Project management processes fall into five groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initiating:</li>
</ol>
<p>In the initiating processes determine the nature and scope of the project.If this stage is not performed well, it is unlikely that the project will be successful in meeting the business’ needs.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Planning:</li>
</ol>
<p>After the initiation stage, the project is planned to an appropriate level of detail.The main purpose is to plan time, cost and resources adequately to estimate the work needed and to effectively manage risk during project execution. As with the Initiation process group, a failure to adequately plan greatly reduces the project&#8217;s chances of successfully accomplishing its goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Executing:</li>
</ol>
<p>While executing we must know what the planned terms that need to be executed are. The execution/implementation phase ensures that the project management plan&#8217;s deliverables are executed accordingly. This phase involves proper allocation, co-ordination and management of human resources and any other resources such as material and budgets. The output of this phase is the project deliverables.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Monitoring and Controlling:</li>
</ol>
<p>Monitoring and controlling consists of those processes performed to observe project execution so that potential problems can be identified in a timely manner and corrective action can be taken, when necessary, to control the execution of the project. The key benefit is that project performance is observed and measured regularly to identify variances from the project management plan.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Closing:</li>

<p>Organizational Development (OD) is necessary when an organization recognizes that a problem exists which affects the mission or health of the organization and change is desired. OD can also be undertaken when leadership has a vision of a better way and wants to improve the organization. An organization does not always have to be in trouble to implement organization development activities.

Organizational Development process begins with careful organization-wide assessment and analysis of the present circumstance and of the future requirements. This assessment can be conducted in many ways including documentation review, organizational sensing, focus groups, interviewing, or surveying. The assessment could be conducted by outside experts or by members of the organization. After the situation is assessed, defined, and understood, the next step is to plan an intervention.

The type of change desired would determine the nature of the intervention. Interventions could include training and development, team interventions such as team building for management or employees or the establishment of change teams, structural interventions, or individual intervention. Once the intervention is planned, it is implemented.

 

During and after the implementation of the intervention, relevant data is gathered. The data gathered would be determined by the change goals. For example, if the intervention were training and development for individual employees or for work groups, data to be gathered would measure changes in knowledge and competencies. This data is used to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. It is reported to the organization’s decision-makers. The decision-makers determine if the intervention met its goals.</p>

						<h3 class="title">Risk Management</h3>
					</div>

					<div class="row abc" >
						<div class="col-md-6">


							<!-- <h3><strong><u>Construction Management</u></strong></h3> -->
							<p>Risk management is the way toward recognizing, surveying and controlling threats to an organization. These dangers, or risks, could come from a wide assortment of sources, financial uncertainty, legal liabilities, strategic management errors, accidents and natural disasters. Recently internet security threats and data-related risks, and the risk management strategies to alleviate them, have become a top priority.</p>
<h3>All r<strong>isk management plans follow these </strong>steps that combine to make up the overall risk management process:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Risk identification:</u></strong>The Company identifies and defines potential risks that may negatively influence a specific company process or project.</li>
<li><strong><u>Risk analysis:</u></strong>Once specific types of risk are identified, the company then determines the odds of it occurring, as well as its consequences. The goal of the analysis is to further understand each specific instance of risk, and how it could influence the company&#8217;s projects and objectives.</li>
<li><a href="http://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/definition/risk-assessment"><strong>Risk assessment</strong></a><strong><u> and evaluation:</u></strong>The risk is then further evaluated after determining the risk&#8217;s overall likelihood of occurrence combined with its overall consequence.<em> </em>The company can then make decisions on whether the risk is acceptable and whether the company is willing to take it on based on its <a href="http://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/definition/risk-appetite">risk appetite</a>.</li>
<li><strong><u>Risk mitigation</u></strong><em>: </em>During this step, companies assess their highest-ranked risks and develop a plan to alleviate them using specific risk controls. These plans include risk mitigation processes, risk prevention tactics and contingency plans in the event the risk comes to fruition.</li>
<li><strong><u>Risk monitoring</u></strong><strong><em><u>:</u></em></strong>Part of the mitigation plan includes following up on both the risks and the overall plan to continuously monitor and track new and existing risks. The overall risk management process should also be reviewed and updated accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Risk management approaches</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the company&#8217;s specific risks are identified and the risk management process has been implemented, there are several different strategies companies can take in regard to different types of risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/definition/risk-avoidance"><strong>Risk avoidance</strong></a><strong><em><u>:</u></em></strong>While the complete elimination of all risk is rarely possible, a risk avoidance strategy is designed to deflect as many threats as possible in order to avoid the costly and disruptive consequences of a damaging event.</li>
<li><strong><u>Risk reduction</u></strong><strong><u>:</u></strong> Companies are sometimes able to reduce the amount of effect certain risks can have on company processes. This is achieved by adjusting certain aspects of an overall project plan or company process, or by reducing its scope.</li>
<li><strong><u>Risk sharing:</u></strong>Sometimes, the consequences of a risk is shared, or distributed among several of the project&#8217;s participants or business departments. The risk could also be shared with a third party, such as a <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/vendor">vendor</a> or business partner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Risk retaining: Sometimes, companies decide a risk is worth it from a business standpoint, and decide to retain the risk and deal with any potential fallout. Companies will often retain a certain level of risk a project&#8217;s anticipated profit is greater than the costs of its potential risk</p>
