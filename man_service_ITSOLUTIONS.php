IT Solution offers to its clients a very rich selection of IT services for application software development, web solutions &amp; multimedia solutions. We offer services in various technological areas and domain areas. The following areas include:</p>
<p><strong> Project Management</strong>:<br />
Project management, is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.</p>
<p>Project management processes fall into five groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initiating:</li>
</ol>
<p>In the initiating processes determine the nature and scope of the project.If this stage is not performed well, it is unlikely that the project will be successful in meeting the business’ needs.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Planning:</li>
</ol>
<p>After the initiation stage, the project is planned to an appropriate level of detail.The main purpose is to plan time, cost and resources adequately to estimate the work needed and to effectively manage risk during project execution. As with the Initiation process group, a failure to adequately plan greatly reduces the project&#8217;s chances of successfully accomplishing its goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Executing:</li>
</ol>
<p>While executing we must know what the planned terms that need to be executed are. The execution/implementation phase ensures that the project management plan&#8217;s deliverables are executed accordingly. This phase involves proper allocation, co-ordination and management of human resources and any other resources such as material and budgets. The output of this phase is the project deliverables.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Monitoring and Controlling:</li>
</ol>
<p>Monitoring and controlling consists of those processes performed to observe project execution so that potential problems can be identified in a timely manner and corrective action can be taken, when necessary, to control the execution of the project. The key benefit is that project performance is observed and measured regularly to identify variances from the project management plan.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Closing:</li>
</ol>
<p>Closing includes the formal acceptance of the project and the ending thereof. Administrative activities include the archiving of the files and documenting lessons learned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
